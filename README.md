This is a placeholder repo to sketch out a web app that can be used to help write letters to legislature.

The requirements that separate it from normal document-writing features are:

* Sometimes you want to write multiple letters about the same topic but personalized. So using templates isn't enough; a living document is a template. It is personalized in child documents, but changes to some parts of child documents should not be reflected in the parent document.  Changes to parts that are not specific to child documents should be reflected in the parent document.  The app should detect where the changes are being made and which other documents they should percolate to.

* Integration with the current list of legslatures and bills being considered in the chambers.

For instance, I'm writing a letter to a sponsor of a bill who is in VA.  I also want to write to my local legislature to ask about supporting of the bill (for upcoming votes) and to mention that I've written to the bill's sponsors.  Having the boilerplate about my support in the latter documents update if I make changes in the first letter, while maintaing the personalized message indicating I've written to the bill's sponsors, would make managing changes much much easier, while enabling a consistently stated message in all letter for one topic.

More to come...
